/**
 * Life in Weeks - Main Application Page
 * 
 * A visual representation of life where each week is displayed as a box in a grid.
 * This is a Next.js adaptation of Gina Trapani's Hugo implementation, preserving
 * the original algorithms while adding modern React features.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Responsive grid layout with pixel-perfect calculations
 * - Decade navigation with scroll synchronization
 * - Color-coded life phases (locations, activities, organizations)
 * - Interactive tooltips for each week/event
 * - Birthday markers and life event highlighting
 * 
 * Data Source:
 * - Life events: src/app/data/life-events.ts
 * - Configuration: WEEKS_CONFIG in life-events.ts
 * - Color mappings: src/app/data/color-mappings.ts
 * 
 * Layout Structure:
 * - life-in-weeks-container: Full-screen container with global reset
 * - life-in-weeks: CSS scope for grid styling (required for .btn, .week classes)
 * - StickyHeader: Navigation and title
 * - WeeksGrid: Main visualization component
